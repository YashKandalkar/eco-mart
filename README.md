# IBM Cloud SQL Database
This tutorial shows how to provision a SQL (relational) database service, create a table and load a larger data set, city information into the database. Thereafter, we deploy a web app "worldcities" to make use of that data and show how to access the cloud database. The app is written in Python using the Flask framework.

This tutorial is part of [IBM Cloud tutorials](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/tutorials?topic=solution-tutorials-tutorials) and discussed as [SQL Database for Cloud Data](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/solution-tutorials?topic=solution-tutorials-sql-database).

# Up and running in few steps
To get this SQL database-backed app up and running only few steps and about 10 minutes are needed. Please follow the steps outlined in the IBM Cloud tutorial.
